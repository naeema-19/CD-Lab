1. Open the input file for reading (inp.txt).
2. Open the symbol table file for writing (result.txt).
3. Open the temporary file for writing constants (con.txt).
4. Initialize variables and data structures:
   - symbols: a 2D array to store identifiers and their values.
   - idstack: a stack to store identifiers during expression evaluation.
   - opstack: a stack to store operators during expression evaluation.
   - idtop: top of the idstack.
   - optop: top of the opstack.
   - bp: buffer pointer for lexeme construction.
   - isd: flag to indicate if the current lexeme is a constant.
   - expecting: flag to indicate if an assignment (=) is expected.
   - isStringLiteral: flag to indicate if the current character is part of a string literal.
   - defining: flag to indicate if currently defining a variable.

5. Read characters from the input file until the end of file:
   a. If the character is part of a string literal:
      - Append it to the symbol table.
   b. If the character is an operator (+, -, *, /):
      - Check for and perform constant propagation if necessary.
   c. If the character is alphanumeric or an underscore:
      - Build the lexeme.
   d. If the character is a special character (; or ,):
      - Check for and perform constant propagation if necessary.
      - Update the symbol table with constant values.
   e. If the character is a comparison or assignment operator:
      - Handle accordingly (set flags, update idstack).
   f. If the character is a parenthesis or bracket:
      - Append it to the symbol table.

6. Close the input file, symbol table file, and temporary file.

7. Display the result, if needed.

Algorithm for Constant Propagation:
1. When encountering an operator, check if there are constants on the stack.
2. If yes, evaluate the operation and replace the operands with the result.
3. Update the symbol table with the new constant value.

Algorithm for Handling Identifiers:
1. When an identifier is encountered:
   a. Check if it's already in the symbol table.
   b. If yes, push its value onto the idstack.
   c. If not, push the identifier onto the idstack.

Algorithm for Handling Special Characters:
1. When a special character (; or ,) is encountered:
   a. Perform constant propagation for the current expression.
   b. If defining a variable, add it to the symbol table.
   c. Reset flags and data structures.

Algorithm for Handling Comparison and Assignment Operators:
1. When a comparison or assignment operator is encountered:
   a. Set flags and update idstack accordingly.

Algorithm for String Literal Handling:
1. When a double quote is encountered:
   a. Toggle the isStringLiteral flag.
   b. Output the double quote to the symbol table.

Algorithm for Error Handling:
1. When an error is detected:
   a. Display an error message with relevant information.
   b. Terminate the program.
