Algorithm TokenizeAndPrint
Input: None
Output: None

1. Open the input file ("input.txt") in read mode.
2. Open the output file ("output.txt") in write mode.
3. Initialize line number (l) to 1, token number (t) to 0, and character array (str) for lexemes.
4. Declare a character variable (ch) to read characters from the input file.
5. Declare a flag variable and index variables (i, j).
6. Define an array of keywords.
7. Print the header for the output file.
8. Loop until the end of the input file is reached:
    a. Initialize i and flag to 0.
    b. Read a character from the input file.
    c. Check for operators (+, -, *, /) and special symbols (;, {, }, (, ), ?, @, !, %), and print accordingly.
    d. If the character is a digit, print it as a digit.
    e. If the character is an alphabet, read the whole word until a space or an alphanumeric character is encountered.
    f. Check if the word is a keyword or an identifier, and print accordingly.
    g. If the character is a newline character, increment the line number (l).
9. Close the input file.
10. Open the output file again in read mode.
11. If the output file opening is unsuccessful, print an error message and return 1.
12. Print the contents of the output file to the console until the end of the file.
13. Close the output file.
14. End.
