Algorithm EpsilonClosureNFA:

1. Open the input file for reading (e.g., "input.txt").

2. Read the number of states (n) from the user.

3. Read the states from the user and store them in the array states.

4. Initialize variables: i = 0, k = 0.

5. Repeat for each state in the array states:
     a. Set i = 0.
     b. Copy the current state to the variable state.
     c. Copy the current state to the variable copy.
     d. Add the current state to the result array.
     e. Repeat while there are transitions in the input:
          i. Read the triple (state1, input_char, state2) from the file.
          ii. If state is equal to state1 and input_char is 'e' (epsilon):
                - Add state2 to the result array.
                - Copy state2 to the variable state.
          iii. Repeat until there are no more transitions.

6. Display the epsilon closure for each state in the result array.

7. Close the input file.
